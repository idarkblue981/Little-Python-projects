Little Python Projects

Welcome to the "Little-Python-Projects" repository! This collection of small Python projects is designed to help you and me practice and improve Python programming skills. Each project is intentionally small in scope, making them perfect for beginners or anyone looking to reinforce their understanding of Python concepts. The projects cover a variety of topics, including basic data structures, algorithms, file handling, and more.

Some projects:
Contact Book: manage a contact book by adding contacts with names and phone numbers
Degree Convertor: convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin
Number Game: the user is prompted to guess a number between 1 and 10, and the program randomly selects a number in that range
Password Generator: allows you to generate a customized password based on user preferences
Rock, Paper, Scissors Game: allows you to play the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game against the computer
Shopping List: create a shopping list by entering products and their prices, and the script provides a summary, including the list of products, the total sum to pay, and information about the biggest and smallest prices
